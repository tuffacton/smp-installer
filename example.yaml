### Creates Kubernetes cluster
### For AWS, it creates an EKS cluster
kubernetes:
  manage: true # If set to false, installer will not execute tofu module for kubernetes cluster
  # cluster_name: ""              # Set this to existing cluster if manage is set to false
  version: "1.29" # Kubernetes version to create the cluster
  airgap: false # Set it to true to install harness in airgap mode
  instance_tags: # Tags to associate with all instances created by installer. Same tags are used by loadbalancer to create target groups
    name: "harness-smp-instance"
  nodes: {} # Override nodes configuration according to your needs. By default, installer will set these values based on profile
  #   machine_type: "t2.2xlarge"
  #   initial_nodes: 5
  #   minimum_nodes: 1
  #   maximum_nodes: 5

### Creates loadbalancer
### For AWS, it creates an ALB
loadbalancer:
  manage: false # If set to false, installer will not execute tofu module for loadbalancer
  # ip: "" # Set this to loadbalancer IP or domain if manage is set to false
  tls:
    enabled: true # Set it to true to enable TLS for the domain.
    existing_certificate_id: "" # Set this to existing certificate id/arn, if empty installer will create a new self-signed certificate
    subject_alternative_names: [] # Subject alternative names for the certificate

### DNS related configuration.
### For AWS, it manages the Route53 configuration. It creates a private zone in route53.
dns:
  manage: false # If set to false, installer will not execute tofu module for dns
  domain: "" # Domain to be used for harness configuration. If empty, installer will use loadbalancer IP/Domain to configure endpoints.
  # zone_id: ""                   # Set this to existing zone id, if manage is set to false
  # zone_name: ""                 # Set this to existing zone name, if manage is set to false
  # private_zone: true            # Set it to true to create a private zone in AWS route53/GCP cloud DNS

### Install external-secrets operator to manage secrets in cloud secret manager
### The secrets operator is installed using helm chart
### For more details, refer to https://external-secrets.io
secretoperator:
  manage: false # If set to false, installer will not execute tofu module for secretoperator
  kubernetes_service_account: "" # Kubernetes service account associated with IAM role to access cloud secret manager. If not provided, installer will create a new service account.
  namespace: "external-secrets" # Namespace to install external-secrets operator

### Manage secrets of databases in cloud secret manager
### The secrets are stored in cloud secret manager and accessed by harness using external-secrets operator
### Currently, the supported databases are minio, mongo, and timescaledb
secrets:
  manage: false # If set to false, installer will not execute tofu module for secrets

### Install monitoring stack
### The monitoring stack includes prometheus, grafana, and alertmanager
monitoring:
  manage: false # If set to false, installer will not install prometheus and grafana helm charts
  enabled: true # Set it to true to enable monitoring configuration in harness
  namespace: "monitoring" # Namespace to install monitoring stack
  prometheus_chart_repository: "" # Prometheus helm chart repository to fetch chart from. Default: oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts
  prometheus_chart_name: "" # Prometheus helm chart name to install. Default: kube-prometheus
  prometheus_chart_version: "10.2.5" # Prometheus helm chart version to install. Set to empty to skip installation
  prometheus_override_file: "" # Prometheus helm chart override file to use for installation
  grafana_chart_repository: "" # Grafana helm chart repository to fetch chart from. Default: https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
